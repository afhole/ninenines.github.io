== Changes since Cowboy 2.2

The following patch versions were released since Cowboy 2.2:

=== Cowboy 2.2.2

* While fixing the miscount in the previous patch release an
  issue was introduced where HTTP/2 bodies could be sent out
  of orders when using iolists. This has been corrected.

=== Cowboy 2.2.1

* Colons are now allowed within path segments in routes provided
  to `cowboy_router:compile/1` as long as they are not the first
  character of the path segment.

* The `cowboy_req:delete_resp_header/2` function will no longer
  crash when no response header was set before calling it.

* A miscount of the output HTTP/2 flow control window has been
  fixed. It prevented sending the response body fully with some
  clients. The issue only affected response bodies sent as iolists.
